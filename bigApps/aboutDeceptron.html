Pennebaker empirically developed measures of how word usage changes when authors are arguing for a position they believe in versus when they are arguing for a position that they do not believe in. The differences are not in the content words that convey the sense of what is written, rather, the differences appear in the small words that do not usually receive attention, either cognitively or linguistically. Pennebaker suggested that deception is characterized by four patterns of change in word frequency.
<br> <br>


    <img src="deceptronAssets/deceptronInfo.png" class = "center" width="70%" />

    
    <br>
<br><br>1. Reduced use of fast-person pronouns, perhaps as a way of distancing the author from the deception
<br><br>2. Reduced use of exception words (but, or, except), perhaps because the cognitive load of creating the deception is too large to allow for fancy touches, or because of an awareness of the need to be consistent if questioned
<br><br>3. Increased use of negative emotion words, perhaps because of negative feelings, inadequately suppressed, about the process or consequences of deception.
<br><br>4. Increased use of action verbs, perhaps as a way of keeping the story mwing, and perhaps only as a consequence of a reduction in other, more-subtle, kinds of verbs. 
<br><br>This model was success applied to the "Enron email dataset". The dataset contains mails to and from Enron employees who never imagined that their writing would be made public. As a result, it has been proven to be an appropriate surrogate for intercepted messages. 

<br><br>
<b>This is how all the factors were generated. Deceptron uses single value decomposition after analyzing all the text values to determine deception. The user must use this app to COMPARE 2 or more pieces of SIMILAR text. This is how the app was intended to be used.</b>
